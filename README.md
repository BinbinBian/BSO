Code for [Sequence-to-Sequence Learning as Beam-Search Optimization](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D16/D16-1137.pdf) (Wiseman and Rush, 2016).

This code is adapted from a much earlier version of Yoon Kim's [seq2seq-attn code](https://github.com/harvardnlp/seq2seq-attn).

An actual README with detailed instructions for running experiments coming soon!
